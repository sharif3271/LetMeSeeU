# LetMeSeeU

## another video chat app
After restrictions to access to free internet for iranian peaple and arguing with configuring for new methods for bypass the filtering system to see my family on realtime show, I have decided to develop a simple application that can work inside of sensored internet with a very low bitrate.

## whats the problem
I bet that this situation is funny for everyone live in a free country. but, in a place, like IRAN, most common tools for comunication like whatsapp, telegram, instagram and dozens of other common application do not work becuase them banned to work by government. Yeah! it's wierd, unbliveable and, funny.
